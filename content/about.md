## Who am I?
I'm currently a Junior Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Science. I try to decode the cryptic patterns that transform themself into the most beautiful creation. Life. With respect to life, I am interested in asking how sequences determine function. In short, I'm a biologist.

## What's on this website?
I blog once in a while and I think it helps me understand the world better. Although I generally blog on biology, I also have a "Life" section where I drop in some random thoughts and experiences.
The [website](https://sivaratnakar.com/) also has a professional section that has some nuanced information about myself.

The blog site is my ways of communicating the way I percieve biology and life, and your chance to get acquainted to something you could carry throughout your life.
