Life in every essence,<br>
in luxury, labour and leisure,<br>
in comfort, despair, and hope,<br>
in prayer, sickness, and routine,<br>
life remains wondrous and astonishing.<br>
<br><br>
The force that moves earth and the miracle of random molecules, unfathomable and intelligible.<br>
The power to bend the star for creation, the spring of growth and the joy of procreation, step by step refining randomness, unfathomable and intelligible.<br><br>
Like the curious wave reaching the land, from oceans and places to the soaring spaces,  a journey outward and then inward, it goes and grows in every course, unfathomable and intelligible.<br><br>
The mystery of consciousness and the enigma of identity, the greatest marvel on the inert gravel, <br>Exploring nature with caution to nurture, the magnanimity of emotion, a true destination. <br>Love and fear, passion and freedom, the perfect blend in the canvas of life, unfathomable and intelligible.<br><br>
Strokes of patterns and delightful pictures, fabricating real and surreal feelings. <br>From abstract to fact, the power to distract, rises art to remain ever intact. Unfathomable and intelligible.<br><br>
Stitching sounds to mean and dream, poetry to feel and stories to fill, imagination comes with heavens to steal. <br>Teleporting minds to worlds with ease, unfathomable and intelligible, the words we scream.<br><br>
Tuning the words with sweetness and elegance, comes the melody resonating with life's brilliance. <br>Wondrous symphony of nature's gift, to grant the fighting soul alift. <br>Words fail and pictures break when music plays in the heart's embrace. <br>The great craving and the means of elevating, unfathomable and intelligible.<br><br>
The moving life jumps to tune. A finesse in act and an escape from distress. <br>Capturing art in all its glory and crafting dance with panache truly.<br> The instinct of celebration blossoms into diverse forms and spreads joy with no bias. Unfathomable and intelligible.<br><br>
Let's celebrate Life that sprouts into many magnificent forms. From nothingness to awe, every step without a flaw. <br>Let's paint, write, sing and dance. Get the beat and grab the chance. <br>Let men judge what you do but all you do is celebrate the now.
