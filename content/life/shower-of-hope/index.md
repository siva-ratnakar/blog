<font size="5">
As she strode along the winding road,<br>
A weary wanderer, with a heavy load,<br>
She longed to find her destined place,<br>
Amidst the endless, scorching space.<br> <br>

The sun beat down with fiery might,<br>
And sandstorms raged from morn till night,<br>
Yet she marched on, with courage true,<br>
Undaunted by the harsh terrain she knew.<br>

Her laboured breaths echoed in her ear,<br>
As she journeyed on, through sweat and fear,<br>
And though the path before her seemed unclear,<br>
She remained steadfast, with hope held near.<br>

She gazed up at the burning sky,<br>
With a prayer on her lips, and a tear in her eye,<br>
And from the crimson, boundless spread,<br>
A glimmer of hope emerged, from red to black.<br>

As the sky shed tears of joy,<br>
The wanderer knew she wasn't just a toy,<br>
But a soul with a purpose, a tale to tell,<br>
One that would end in triumph, not in hell<br>
