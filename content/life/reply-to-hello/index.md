All of us might be aware of the song "Hello" by Adele. It's a song where the women calls her love, but he seems not to answer. But can he? Maybe he was struck in these intricate thoughts.

Hello. That's all I would have known.<br>
Coz the pain is not yours alone.

There was no life that we shared, and your heart, I've never cared, so I said, to an empty mirror I stared.<br>
With every thought of yours, my heart raced, but raised my mind too. For myself I geared, but I wish I dared.<br>
So yeah, Hello. That's all I would have known.
Coz the pain is not yours alone.<br>

My tears stop rare and I'll never be fair. <br>
Knowing not why I punish myself with no spare, you feel the same, I'm aware.<br>
So yeah, Hello. That's all I would have known.
Coz the pain is not yours alone.

It's time to free you like a dove, but my hands are full, love <br> So take a room of your own, coz the pain is not mine alone.
