Hi Amigos!<br> Greetings from my new <a href="https://sivaratnakar.com/">website</a>, The Curious Explorer
</font></center><br>
"I shall never ever have my own website", I told one of my friends a few months back. But what made me change my mind? Let me take you all through a small tour of what led me to get this website.

It was during the time when the whole world started doing new and cool stuff. It was during the COVID-19 pandemic that I started blogging on different topics of biology. I had a WordPress site and the blogging journey was going great. I liked tapping into the creative part of my brain and distilling biology for the common man. That's when I was awed by the joy of expressing my mind through tangible words. It was rather fascinating to see that most of the mind is inherently abstract unless kept in words. 

Materializing thoughts into words became a fun activity. I also started to write random topics other than biology. This was the time when my brother, a software developer started making his own site. I couldn't care less, but the thought of owning your website was intriguing. My lesser care was to the fact that owning a site would mean buying, hosting, deploying, and developing-  all of which encouraged boredom to me. And yeah, WordPress was going well.

While developing a website was a professional task for my brother, it never occurred to me that I would want something like that too. A site where I could show myself. As time passed, one of my friends, Siddarth saw my blogging site and gifted me a blogging domain for my birthday. He works with Hugo themes for blogging sites and wanted me to have my own blogging site. And with the domain in hand, I wanted to make good use of it.

So the task was to make my personal website. My blogging website name was "The Curious Explorer". So this was my website name too. And since I want my personal website, I started to ask what defines me. Although that is a seemingly complex answer, I primarily grouped myself as someone researching biology and living my life. From these thoughts came my web pages and the design of the home screen of my page.

I am a curious explorer. I try to see beauty in otherwise ordinary things. So this needed a minimalistic design that displays beauty when you explore it. The feature is better seen on a desktop site than on a mobile screen. The blogging pages the website leads to are Bio blog where I blog on different topics of biology, and Life, where I write about other aspects of life. It includes travel blogs, some thoughts, or blogs like these. And then comes the professional blog that acts like my CV, and a contact page for my readers to reach me. (At the time of writing this blog, the last two pages are under development.)

Siddharth has bought the domain in Hostinger and the website is being deployed through Netlify. The blogging site is based on Hugo themes and the rest of the pages are developed on Flutter. My brother Sai Rajendra has helped me build the website on Flutter, and without these people, the website would only be a dream. If any of you reading this would want a website of your own, you could sure reach out to me and I shall connect you to either of them who I'm sure are ready to take up freelance work.
