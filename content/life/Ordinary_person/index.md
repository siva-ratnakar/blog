Many aim to be exceptional. Some are blessed with talent and some work hard to get there. Others care less but live their lives with fulfilment. There are different kinds of people, different kinds of perspectives, and different kinds of struggles. 
Among these is a kind of people who are overlooked, who blend like grey in a canvas of exciting colours, the yellow of a traffic light, darkness of a night sky, a mirror's quiet reflection, life's stillness out of sight. 
These people seek and strive for extremes but at some point realise that they are running hard but standing still in the relentless race. Neither can they reach nor can they give up. Although they know it's futile, these are the people that keep going. 
This description might deceive you into thinking these are extraordinary people. Alas, these are regular, ordinary people. People who are the rivets to the popper, the major kind of people. Poets sing of grand achievements, stories, and songs talk in detail of epic journeys, but no writer is interested in ordinary people. The truth is, there is nothing special to talk about them. A regular ordinary person has no tale to tell.

He has no smiles to share, no despair to spare, and no stories to speak<br>
For him, time with friends or solo is the same, for self-companionship, his aim<br>
Having the fear of missing out he is also threatened to reach out<br>
He takes comfort in laziness and labour alike<br>
A paradox that keeps him in a bind, peace he cannot find<br>

She doesn't think of being loved, for deservedness never knocked on her door<br>
She doesn't wish you to spotlight her because she sometimes enjoys the dark<br>
Only her mirror recognizes her gentle eyes and she seeks nothing more fair<br>
She seeks joy in tasting apples and oranges, simple yet joyous forage<br>

These people shout hard and are not tired, their echo is their only reassurance<br>
They share their world with hearts alight, and sharing with none, also delight<br>
They give up looking for a point and celebrate nothingness<br>
Life is not a bed of roses for them, but a sea of storm<br>
Life seems to have no purpose but they don't need a purpose to smile<br>
With every tale untold, a silent strength unfolds in the life of an ordinary where true strength holds<br>


This writing, not a dedication to the ordinary. Their lives, their only dedication. Matters not for ordinary people like us to bask in glory, but it does make a difference to provide a warm touch of relatability. People out there, these lines are nothing more than a nod for your journey. Keep running with pride even when no cheer is near.
