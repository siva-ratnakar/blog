There is an old Indian song where the woman claims that she is the beauty for her man. For me, this seemed a bit unusual. I felt that this was expressing pride or ego. So I went through a small stroll of beauty, and this is what occured to me. Voyage with me for a while<br>

And as I was going through this journey, the last line made me realise that claiming to be a beauty for your partner does not reflect ego. I realised that love indeed gives you the right to claim your partner as your own, just the way a devotee can claim the lord as his own.
