It's fascinating how a simple phrase can unlock such profound reflections on growth and personal philosophy. "Seeking Discomfort". It's a curious phrase I read a long time ago. It was, to me, surprising to learn that some people actively seek discomfort. I could only unravel this deeper truth after I entertained the phrase for a little while.

While comfort cheers you, it also stagnates. Or... maybe it's the other way around. Maybe stagnation IS comfort, a lullaby that lulls potential into slumber. Consequently, growth must be uncomfortable. Come to think of it... it is.

An arrow only soars under the pressure of relentless force. Similarly, to plunge into success, one must often navigate the shadowed valleys of struggle. It is amply clear that growth cannot be reached without struggle, and "Seeking Discomfort" is an unyielding mirror of "Growing Forward".

The phrase "Seeking Discomfort" indeed resonates with the tough reality of growth. When I say the tough reality, I reverberate many mixed frequencies. The discomfort could be a long and tiring workout session, the grueling hours of practice, each repetition a sting, a fleeting discomfort in the present. But with every swing of the bat, every line of code written, every missed moment with a loved one, a future victory, a blossoming skill, promising a harvest of joy.

The deeper I delved, the more I validated the outcome of such a lifestyle. But this is a blog by a curious explorer and it ends not without a twist. While I call it a twist in this writing, to me it was perhaps an unacceptance. I could not accept discomfort. The phrase indicates "Growth as a responsibility", but I prefer "Growth as a byproduct".

Let us turn to the ancient wisdom of Hindu mythology for a moment, though my parallels may not be perfectly precise, they serve to illuminate the point.

Consider Angada, a great warrior, carrying the burden of legacy and duty. When he entered Ravana's court, he planted his foot firmly on a stool, daring anyone to move it even by a centimeter. His firm resolve and dutiful confrontation proved his strength. On one hand, there was Angada with unrivaled resolve and on the other was a playful Hanuman.
Hanuman represents boundless agency, a spirit of expansive freedom. In Ravana's court, he leaped and evaded capture, using his tail to set Lanka ablaze. His power was not born from enduring hardship, but from transcending it, a magnificent byproduct of his inherent nature. Indian culture often celebrates this latter approach.

These aspects are what I meditated on to better understand "Seeking Discomfort". In both cases, the characters display their immense power, but Angada embodies a stoic acceptance of trial, while Hanuman's strength flows from a place of "Enjoying Freedom". In life, one feels that they are being shackled by comfort, or be it when you are in the clutches of stage fright, financial traps, or the subtle chains of anger, greed, and lust; working outward to freedom and more importantly, enjoying the process of doing so defines "Enjoying Freedom".

If you look closer, the outward results of "Seeking Discomfort" and "Enjoying Freedom" may look similar while breaking the loop; the underlying philosophy and approach diverge. One climbs with firm feet, the other dances on winds where horizons meet. One may bend the frame, the other deems no claim. One would focus on periodic arduous attempts, the other would focus on periodic contempt. After all, isn't pain an interval between moments of pleasure? To seek one may not be inherently superior to seeking the other. One focuses on the goal, and the other transcends to serenity. My choice: serenity.

Neither path is without its potential pitfalls.
"Seeking Discomfort" might not always push you towards growth, because growth is not discomfort, but movement is. And the movement can lead in any direction. The relentless attitude to discomfort could instill a burden of legacy and may legitimize hardship. But most importantly, it takes out the luxury of contempt.
"Enjoying Freedom" can be mistaken for paralyzing. It is hard to realize that freedom lies in exploration and expansion. When the clutches of comfort are perceived as a cushion of secure embrace, one risks remaining a slave of tranquility.

Maybe vocabulary falters to express the sheer joy of freedom and exploration. Yet, I hope this small piece of reflection offers a release, freeing myself and fellow travelers of life from discomfort's clench. For, what better liberation exists than the tranquility of growth?
