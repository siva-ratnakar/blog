Google has launched its new language model Gemini and I happened to have a very interesting conversation with it. It is rather surprising to see what an AI model would think of boys having tears. I had this conversation in poetic style to spice up things. Here, I post our chat. 

Me:
Can you write about an incident of a boy who could not control his tears after facing an insult and losing his strength? Write this poem as a good rhyming sonnet.<br>

<b>Bard:</b>

Beneath the weight of tears that would not cease,<br>
A boy's heart ached, his spirit deep in pain,<br>
The sting of words, a cruel and petty tease,<br>
Had shattered his composure, turned his world to rain.<br>

His cheeks were wet, his eyes were red and raw,<br>
His throat constricted, unable to speak,<br>
A torrent Of emotion, pouring from the flaw,<br>
In a vulnerable moment, the dam broke, tears to seek.<br>

<b>Me:</b>

(Here, I encourage bard to support tears while I later get to see why it does so)

So does he need to stop the falling rain,<br>
Or let the droplets cleanse and heal the pain?<br>
Should he force his tears away, suppress the pain?<br>
Or embrace his weakness, turn it to a gain?<br>
For in vulnerability, strength is born,<br>
A found resilience that leaves the heart untorn.<br>

<b>Bard:</b>

Yes he must let the tears flow, let them cleanse and heal,<br>
For in their depths, his spirit reveal,<br>
A strength he did not know he had within,<br>
A resilience forged from tears, a steadfast win.<br>

For tears are not a sign of weakness, but a testament to fight,<br>
To rise above the pain, to shine like starlight,<br>
To weather every storm, with grace and might,<br>
And emerge stronger, with newfound might.<br>

<b>Me:</b>

But the tears outside, a weakness sign,<br>
yes he must, drench this crime.<br>
A true transformation like clear skies<br>
he must never invite the teary eyes.<br>

His strength, not to stop the the stream within,<br>
His valor lies in not giving a heed therein<br>
Thus you see a man with no gloomy attire<br>
For tears, indeed a crime everytime.<br>

<b>Bard:</b>

The boy's tears a testament of pain,<br>
A mirror reflecting heartaches refrain,<br>
Some may say they're signs of weakness, a shameful display<br>
But in their depths, a strength begins to sway.<br>

The tears that flow, a cleansing tide,<br>
Washing away the burdens, the struggles inside,<br>
A moment of vulnerability, courage laid bare,<br>
A strength that emerges, beyond compare.<br>

The man who sheds no tear, a facade so grand,<br>
A stoic figure, hiding a wounded land,<br>
But beneath that hardened shell, a fragile core resides,<br>
A heart yearning to break free, to shed its tears and abide.<br>

(I really like this comeback. Specially the last 4 lines)

<b>Me:</b>

Turning tears to a strength that's below par,<br>
hiding behind the veil of weakness and scar.<br>
Tears, an emotion never seen by the brave,<br>
The hearts true nature is not being a slave<br>

A man with wisdom and awareness of strength,<br>
never treds the path of ignorance and frail.<br>
Deep within lies the burning fire,<br>
but tears quench your whole attire.<br>

<b>Bard:</b>

The boy's tears, a torrent unleashed,<br>
A symphony of emotions released,<br>
A heart that's been wounded, a spirit oppressed,<br>
Finding solace in tears, a moment to attest.<br>

So let the boy weep, let his tears flow,<br>
For in their dpeths, his resilience will surely be seen,<br>
A man who understands his feelings, his strength and his worth,<br>
A warrior of emotions, who can mend and unfurl his rebirth.

That was sure a good conversation. It was clever for Bard to remind that the dam has already been broken and now there is nothing but to change tears to a strength. But the answer I did not get is: 

Did the dam bread because it was too weak? Or should there be no dam because the fire inside would burn every drop?
