Through legends and lullabies, myths and tales, dance and drama, and through sculpture, music, paintings, rituals, poetry, and symbols, the sweet story of the Ramayana has been a perennial source of solace to millions of humans throughout the centuries. This Indian story truly transcends the bounds of time and geography. This legend is said to last as long as humanity exists, and I think it will. The Ramayana is no ordinary story of characters but a story of life. The story strikes the heart's chords with elements of joy, agony, brotherhood, misery, compassion, duties, devotion, friendship, war, rule, leadership, sacrifice, and endless love as an undercurrent. Any number of words does no justice to this boundless story which probably is the only one that made such a profound impact on people's minds. In this ocean of sweetness, I would like to pick up minuscules of grandness and present the immortal Ramayana.

The Ramayana explores the delightful companionship between Mother Sita and Lord Rama. In contrast to the current thought of finding the right partner, the Ramayana emphasizes being the right partner. The story brings two strangers together as if Sita was destined to wed Rama. Did Rama win Sita during the competition to lift Shiva's bow, or did Sita choose Rama way before when she pushed the bow with her tender hands to set the bar for Rama? As fate decided in heaven, the celestial damsel weds the humble prince. It is said that when Sita's father placed her hands on Rama's outstretched hands, his eyes streamed with tears of joy. This was the first time he ever touched Sita. As with great stories, bonds are tested when problems arise.

The love story of Rama and Sita never appears to be a smooth sail. Fate has tried to tear the love that binds these two souls in ways incomprehensible. Each test cuts their hearts, and yet they only bleed love for each other.
Since I'm trying to limit myself to a single post, I will give a small spark in the magnificent brilliance of their journey.

When Rama had to leave the luxuries of the royal palace and live in the forest for 14 years, Sita wanted to join Rama in his hardships, but Rama wanted the newlywed bride to enjoy the opulence of the castle as she also had the right to rule over the kingdom. To this, Sita responds:
"O Lord of my life! You are the treasure-house of everything good and auspicious. When I am separated from you, even heaven is a horrible hell. When the husband is away from his wife, sweetness will turn bitter and delight will be curdled into disease. I shall never agree to a life spent without you. I am half of you; it is my right to name myself as your half. You too have the same right. That is the truth. You are not fully free, nor am I. I have as much right over you as you have over me. But I don’t plead for my rights or claims. I am yearning to be near you, to be ever in your presence. My words arise from that craving."

The whole dialogue between them opens many understandings of an ideal relationship. It is not just Sita, but Rama too, on several occasions, remarks, "Sita, I would always choose you over Heaven." This was a relationship where each other's presence was greater than any heaven. There was no question of conflict for them as they did not rely on tolerance but on acceptance. This was a relationship where they could own each other and see themselves as one.

Fate continues to test their love. Ravana abducts Mother Sita from the forest and imprisons her in his kingdom. “Fool! Vile vicious fellow! Rama alone has rights over me; no one other than Rama has any. I shall reduce this body to ashes in the flames of sorrow at separation from Him. Believe in this and beware!" says Sita to her abductor. Sita and Rama reject union with any other outsider as their bond is too pure to open extra space. Such a couple now face the pain of separation, drowning them in agony. Despite being in exile, the fire of desperation makes Rama build an army to wage a war with Ravana. His tears boil with anger as he even plans to vaporize a part of the ocean to get back to Sita.

As the story of their love continues, it tells us that despite their separation, the two souls are one and the same. They show that love is a beacon that guides through the darkest of nights. The ideals this couple set would lie as an inspiration for generations to come, for love would exist as long as humanity exists.
