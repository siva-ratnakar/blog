_Here’s something about me_

Like it or not, this blog is biased towards my ideologies and beliefs. What better reason to get to know about me?

**Why am I blogging?**

- Blogs are easy and simple way of expressing your thoughts to the world.
- Because I can think of ways how I could explain Biology to my Grandma.

I’m here to publish my Manuscript on Reviews, Perspectives, Case Studies and Rapid Communications. I’m here to write them for YOU, not for a Scientific audience.

**What will I blog here?**

I haven’t decided yet. But you could possibly expect these

- Reviews
- Perspectives
- Case Studies
- Rapid Communications

**Am I not supposed to Introduce the blogger?**

Siva Ratnakar is his name. A wonderful person I have ever met. I should tell you that this person is a charm. As a child, he is a bit naughty and playful. As a student, he is sincere and disciplined. And as a friend, a trouble-free person to rely on either for class notes or for keeping secrets. He is a person good with relations and respects other’s space. Ratnakar is definitely not a God-fearing man, but a God-loving man. He believes that his birth has a higher purpose of service to the needed. He thinks his mind is the tool for this. He is a Way too optimistic person. He calls himself a Biologist-Most renowned in his field.

He is pursuing his post-graduation in Biosciences from “Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning”. Previously completed his high school studies at “St. Andrews School” and his schooling in “Sri Chaitanya School”.

Well, I’m the blogger. I’m Siva Ratnakar. Just asked myself to introduce myself.

Kindly note!! This is my first blog and first manuscript.
