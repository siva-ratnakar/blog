Did someone tell you that you should not discontinue the prescription of Antibiotics given by your doctor? Did you know that self-medication with antibiotics is a step ahead to wipe out humanity? Why would that happen? Here is a true story to explain that. Read it carefully…..

Once upon a time, there lived a king named Hue. The people in this kingdom lived in harmony until the day when the People of the Village Bee stopped paying taxes. As is the rule, King Hue wanted to punish them with a life sentence or a capital punishment if found ungovernable. To attack the Bees, Hue prepared the army of Abs. Knowing this; the Bees took refugee of their Village deity–Angel µ (Mue). Moved by their devotion, Angel µ said: “To those Bees who survive the havoc created by the Abs, I shall give them the knowledge of Invisibility”. Saying these seemingly insignificant words, the Angel disappeared into thin air.

The army of Abs attacked the Bees and has wiped out the majority of the population. As assured by the Angel, those who survived received the knowledge of Invisibility. Bees now have the power given by µ that would save them from any attack of Abs. They shared this knowledge to their friends in other villages and also passed it to their coming generations. The Bees looked invincible until King Hue prepared another army of Abs who could see the invisible. Angel µ would help the Bees again.

To be continued…

Cast

King Hue    :       Humans

Abs              : Antibiotics

Bees            :       Bacteria

Angel µ       :       Mutation

Mutations made Bacteria more powerful that, they are now resistant to almost any kind of antibiotic. It is estimated that by 2050, 1 in every 3 humans shall die of Bacterial infections.

##What do you think?

-King Hue, should have listened to his Dr. Minister and sent a bigger army of Abs to wipe out all the Bees in their kingdom? (Completion of Prescribed Antibiotics)
-Should King Hue send his Abs to any other village unnecessarily? (Excessive use of Antibiotics in Agriculture and Poultry)
-Should Hue use the same kind of Abs again and again? (Repeated use of the same antibiotic)

##Any Hope?

-We use different Abs every time, and make sure not to leave any survivors.
-Use Abs only when necessary. (To slow down the process)
-Hope Scientists find a new type of army.
